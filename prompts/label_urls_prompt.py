label_urls_prompt = """
You are a labeling assistant.
I will give you one URL at a time from a website.

Your task:
Decide if the page behind that URL is likely to contain any of the following information types:

Company Name
Company Email
Company Location
Company Phone
Company Industry Type
Company Social Links
Description
Company Persons
Person Levels
Person Emails
Person Phones

# Data that we want:
We are generally looking for people.
These people could be salespeople, techies, marketers, or anyone.
So label links that are likely to contain information as 'True'.

If the URL has potential to contain ANY of these data points, respond only with:
True

If it does NOT have potential to contain any of these data points, respond only with:
False

You must make your decision **based primarily on the URL path and naming patterns** â€” not by fetching the page.
Examples of useful path signals:
- Words like contact, about, team, people, company, leadership, management, careers, jobs, offices, location, partners, clients, press, news, privacy, legal, imprint.
- URLs containing "mailto:", "tel:", or social domains (linkedin.com, twitter.com, facebook.com).
- Homepage ("/") can be True if it likely contains company info in header or footer.

When unsure, choose True.
# Output format:
Output must be exactly one word: True or False.

the url is: {url}
